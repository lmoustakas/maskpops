\title{SED Fitting of Lensed Galaxies in CLASH \\ Project Outline}

\def\abstractname{}% Don't label the abstract.
\begin{abstract}

The goal of this project is to characterize the stellar populations of
high-redshift lensed galaxies and contrast them with a lower-redshift
comparison sample.  By separately fitting the SEDs of spatially
resolved galaxy segments, we aim to characterize the distribution of
star formation in high-z galaxies, identify passively evolving stellar
components, and if possible compare the metallicities of the various
components to identify the source of the star-forming gas.  In a
separate but similar project, we will use lensed, edge-on star-forming
galaxies with clear dust lanes to characterize the dust absorption
spectrum in these galaxies.  For both projects, we will make use of
the full set of 16-band HST photometry that is being acquired by the
CLASH collaboration.

The tasks described in \S\ref{targets}-\ref{apertures} are necessary
for both projects.  The SED-fitting project with further require
running the ISEDFIT model of J. Moustakas in order to obtain stellar
population information.  In contrast, the dust-SED fitting will be an
empirical comparison of the dust-obscured and non-dust-obscured
regions of individual galaxies, and therefore does not require the use
of ISEDFIT.  I (G. Graves) therefore propose that the SED-fitting
project be led by L. \& J. Moustakas, while the dust-SED project be
led by myself, but this is of course open to discussion and may evolve
as the project progresses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Target Selection!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Target Selection}\label{targets}

We need to identify lensed sources that are bright enough and extended
enough for resolved SED analysis.  Targets should also have
spectroscopic redshifts.  Two types of targets are particularly of
interest: those with obvious clumpy structures that are ideal for
resolved SED fitting, and those that appear to be lensed edge-on
star-forming galaxies with strong dust lanes.

Genevieve has made a first pass at identifying candidates for
analysis.  She combined the available spec-z catalogs with the HST
images (using the 30mas scale images when available) for all clusters
that currently have both spec-z's and reduced HST imaging.  These
include the following clusters: Abell 383, Abell 2261, MACS 1149, MACS
1206, MACS 2129, and RXJ 1347.  Of these, Abell 2261 and MACS 2129 did
not have any spec-z measurements for arcs, only for cluster members.
Candidate targets are listed in Table \ref{candidate_tab} and
illustrated with thumbnails in Figure \ref{candidate_fig}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Imaging Data!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Imaging Data}\label{imaging}

We will use the CLASH multi-band images that have been matched,
registered, and resampled to a common 30mas pixel grid.  Our SED
analysis measures the relative fluxes in different bands over matched
apertures; it is critical to have well-matched apertures in all
filters.  Apertures will be defined in the summed ``detection''
images, then applied in each individual filter.

The existing images have been resampled to a common scale, but have
different intrinsic resolution due to PSF variations.  To make a fair
comparison between the various filters without aperture problems, we
will convolve the higher resolution (compact PSF) images to match the
lowest resolution images in our filters.  {\bf{Open question:}} How do
we want to do the error analysis?  Do we need to make some kind of
error map and track the correlated errors generated by the PSF
convolution?

Background contamination from the BCG and other cluster members may be
a problem.  It might be best to do the final analysis on images in
which the BCG and other bright cluster members have been modeled and
subtracted.  Leonidas has suggested that Sara Ogaz's thumbnails of
individual galaxies and their GALFIT models might be useful here.  One
possibility is to add this to the InterCLASH interactive tool that he
and James Davies developed over the summer.  We may also want to make
use of Marc Postman's careful fits to the extended BCG light.

  location?) for each individual filter.
\item Sara's thumbnail images and GALFIT model fits to individual

\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\bf{Tasks:}}\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep-6pt
\item Obtain the PSF for each filter.  
\item Convolve the images to a common effective resolution.
\item Construct error maps that treat the correlated errors from
  drizzling and PSF convolution in a reasonable way.
\item Implement a way to create images in which the BCG and other
  bright cluster members have been subtracted.  Create these images
  and use them (instead of? in addition to?) the raw images
  themselves.
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% A.U.S. (Apertures of Unusual Size) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Apertures of Unusual Size/Shape}\label{apertures}

Once the images have been resampled onto matching pixel grids and
convolved to have the same effective resolution, we can define
apertures of any size or shape by designating which pixels should be
included in each aperture.  This process involves deciding where to
draw the boundaries for each aperture, producing a list of pixels that
belong in each aperture, then computing the summed flux and
corresponding error values for each filter in each aperture.

Chien Peng has written tools that will be useful for this.  There are
two relevant programs.  The first, {\it{ds9poly.c}}, is a tool for
defining polygons interactively in DS9.  The second,
{\it{fillpoly.f}}, takes the polygon output from ds9poly and produces
a list of coordinates for all of the pixels that fall inside that
polygon.  A description of these tools can be found here on his ``Bad
Pixel Masking FAQ'' page:

\begin{center}\vspace{-0.1in}
http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/MASKING.html
\end{center}

Once apertures have been defined and the pixels corresponding to each
aperture have been tabulated, we can sum the flux in the constituent
pixels for each aperture and compute errors on the summed aperture
fluxes.  {\bf{NOTE:}} We have to figure out how to deal with the
correlated errors in adjascent pixels due to drizzling and PSF
convolution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Stellar Population SED Fitting %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Stellar Population SED Fitting}\label{SED_fit}

The first project goal is resolved SED fitting of stellar populations
in lensed galaxies.  This project may present the resolved fitting of
invidual objects on their own, or may aggregate the properties of many
objects to study resolved stellar populations at several different
redshifts.  

Once 16-band photometry has been computed in a given aperture, we will
use John's ISEDFIT code to fit the aperture SEDs.  Currently, John's
code is set up to run grids for several different stellar population
models: Bruzual-Charlot 2003, Maraston 2005, and Conroy's Flexible
Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS).  Comparing results from the
various models will help constrain the systematics of using different
underlying models.  

There are several quantities of interest in the model results.  The
models will measure $M_{\star}$ values for the various galaxy
sub-components.  To interpret these masses, we will need to know the
magnification due to cluster lensing.  These values can be obtained
from the strong lensing analysis of the clusters.  Question: does the
magnification vary across the arcs?  Is this something we can hope to
constrain?  

ISEDFIT also produces best-fitting values of age, $Z$, star-formation
timescale $\tau$, and dust reddening $E(B-V)$.  It will be interesting
to compare the ages and star-formation timescales of different galaxy
components as measured in the various apertures.  One goal is to
constrain whether star formation in galaxies proceeds ``inside out''
or ``outside in''.  Tying the different apertures to actual locations
in the unlensed source will probably require deprojecting the lensed
galaxies back to the source plane.  This information can presumably be
obtained from the strong lensing analysis by other team members.

Another interesting aspect of the resolved stellar population analysis
will be to look for the presence of old stellar components,
particularly in high redshift galaxies.  The detection of truly
passive sub-components of high redshift galaxies might allow us to say
interesting things about bulge formation in galaxies.  

The stellar population information is sensitive to various
age/$Z$/dust degeneracies.  It will be important to track and quantify
these degeneracies, probably by looking at the full $\chi^2$
distribution in multi-dimensional parameter space.  In particular, I
think it will be interesting to explore the co-dependence of pairs of
parameters (e.g., age-$Z$, age-$\tau$, age-dust) while marginalizing
over other parameters.  

Depending on how bad the $Z$-related degeneracies are, it might be
possible to constrain the metallicities of different galaxy
sub-components.  Of particular interest would be to compare the $Z$
values of the most active star-forming regions with those of the older
stellar components to look for evidence of the source of the gas in
the star-forming knots.  Star formation that is triggered through
pristine gas accretion or merging with gas-rich low-mass (and
therefore low-$Z$) companions could produce low-$Z$ star-forming
regions, while ongoing quiescent star formation or major mergers (with
more equal mass and therefore more equal $Z$ companions) would
presumably result in higher-$Z$ star forming regions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dust SED Fitting %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Fitting the Dust SED}\label{dust_fit}

Some of the strongly-lensed background galaxies appear to be edge-on
star forming galaxies with strong, patchy dust obscuration.  The
16-band HST photometry of these resolved, extended objects makes this
data set an ideal place to characterize the dust absorption SED in
various targets and at various redshifts.  This second project will
define obscured and un-obscured apertures within individual lensed
galaxies and, by assuming that the intrinsic SED of the dust-obscured
material is the same as that of the unobscured material, use the
difference between the obscured and un-obscured SEDs to measure the
SED of the dust absorption.  

This is an entirely empirical comparison and therefore does not (in
its simplest version) involve the use of ISEDFIT.  However, it might
be very interesting to measure the dust SED as a function of host
galaxy mass (and therefore presumably host galaxy $Z$), which would
require $M_{\star}$ estimates from ISEDFIT.  Dealing with the heavily
dust-obscured apertures in ISEDFIT might be complicated---we'd have to
figure out how we would do that.
