With the combination of all of the bands in CLASH, there are 
many things that can be done in the study of the background 
galaxies, particularly taking advantage of the magnifications 
(even for galaxies that have not been multiply imaged), and 
distortions.

* photometric redshifts in general
* spatially resolved pixel-by-pixel colors towards color-color diagrams
* for galaxies at certain sweet-spot redshifts, the emission at certain
  wavelengths based on narrow or medium band photometry vis a vis the overall
  SED fit.  we can look at this in detail, and should map out predictions for
  o Lyman alpha at redshifts z=...
  o H alpha at redshifts z=...
  o What other?
  o Is it possible at any one redshift to see multiple emission lines across 
    different filters? 
  These can be used for mapping ionizing photons, emitting-light structure 
  as compared to continuum-light structure (resonant scattering? morphologies?
  locations of star formation in the merging or evolution process)
